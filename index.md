Today, businesses, consumers, communities, and societies generate vast amounts of data through their activities. Companies across all industries are increasingly relying on data analytics to enhance or replace intuition and guesswork in decision-making. This shift allows business managers to leverage their data and analytical skills to uncover new patterns and insights or conduct controlled experiments to test hypotheses.

This course equips students with an understanding of business analytics and prepares them to be leaders in this field within business organizations. It teaches the scientific process of transforming data into insights for making better business decisions, covering the methodologies, issues, and challenges of analyzing business data.

Students will learn through practical application, using business analytics algorithms and methodologies to solve various business problems. Carefully selected examples illustrate key analytical processes, teaching students how to avoid common pitfalls and emphasizing the importance of proper techniques. The course also highlights that there can often be more than one "good answer" or "right choice." It underscores the importance of being discerning in selecting data for analysis and in the analytical approaches used.
